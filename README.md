A database for a chain of Cat Cafes that stores information about Stores, Employees, Cats, Partner Agencies, Customers, Orders, and Menu Items. An adoption agency partners with a store and provides a way for customers to adopt cats. While the cats are awaiting adoption, they live in the store. Customers can order drinks and food at the store. 

Having a database that stores information about cats awaiting adoption, customer orders, menu items, and employees can make operating the chain of cat cafes smoother and improve communication between different branches of the chain. Using a single database to track information across the chain allows different branches to maintain the core underlying structure of some entities, such as MenuItem. With MenuItem instances, local stores are able to add their own seasonal menu item options. 

We intend for the end user to be an employee, who is able to view information on the cats, add or delete items to the menu, and take customer orders.
